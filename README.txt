This is my entry for the $20 Newspaper Contest on CodingPlanet.org

This code is only intended as a code practice for myself and as my entry to the contest on Coding Planet.
I'm still a beginner and I'm sure there's a better way to code a lot of what I wrote (such as using proper margins and padding
rather than a bunch of <br> tags) but anyhow, enjoy my project!

P.S. I discovered your website on MC-Market
